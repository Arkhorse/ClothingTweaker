# Clothing Tweaker
Allows you to adjust the warmth, warmth when wet, windproof, waterproof, protection, mobility and weight of clothing items. 

Now you can wear anything you want, instead of the exact same 'best' set of clothes every game! 

_WILL BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH MODS THAT ALSO ALTER THESE CLOTHING STATS!_ 

Now includes support for the clothes added by [ClothingPack](https://github.com/ds5678/Clothing-Pack), [NorthfolkClothingPack](https://github.com/HAHAYOUDEAD/NorthfolkClothingPack), [PrisonPack](https://github.com/TheDevv/Prison-Pack) and [WolfskinScarf](https://github.com/Atlas-Lumi/TLD-WolfskinScarf) mods.    


Compatible with [Weight Tweaks](https://github.com/Xpazeman/tld-weight-tweaks) by Xpazeman, just leave the "Clothing Modifier" setting at 1.00 if you want to use the weight settings in ClothingTweaker instead. It's fine to change "Worn Clothing Modifier".
